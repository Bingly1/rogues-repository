# rogues-repository

this is my repository for malware! mostly rogues and other "cool" things i find while browsing sketchy sites.
i also have no idea how to use github so bare with me

pass for the zip files is "Bingle"

every zip file comes with a file that you gotta rename into an exe and a text file with a basic description of what youre gonna get yourself into by opening it

do NOT use these files for any harmful purposes. these files are for research and educational purposes.
