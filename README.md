# rogues-repository

this is my repository for malware! mostly rogues and other "cool" things i find while browsing sketchy sites.
i also have no idea how to use github so bare with me

pass for the zip files is "Bingle"

every zip file comes with a file in the .bingly1 extension that you have to rename to .exe to run it

do NOT use these files for any harmful purposes. these files are for research and educational purposes.
